# Preprocessing -overview
Almost 50,000 ads on second-hand cars were collected from a popular french site. Complementary data was also extracted to better encode brands.

The preprocessing was done in two steps:
* First, an Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted on the training set to know how to best clean the data
* Then, some preprocessing was applied to the entire set (filtering noise, dropping unnecessary features, fixing data errors) then most of the preprocessing was applied to only the raw training set
